# 14-Day-solidity-code-challenge
Implementation of certain concepts in solidity via projects
* * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * Day 1-5 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
    The contents of the project involved implementing struct manipulation
    in solidity;
    Using arrays to access and group a given number of structs
    Also, using the Chainlnk to get live price feed so as to have dynamic prices
    according to current market value
    Also, contract interaction; whereby one contract contained the transactional Logic 
    The other solely reflecting the flow and structure of the project
    Implementing concepts like the function inheritance was also demonstrated in the first project in this course
